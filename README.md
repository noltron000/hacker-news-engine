## RTS Labs Take-Home Project
This is what we'd like to see for an at-home exercise.

### Requirements
- Use React and Redux to complete this project.
- Build an application that lets the user search the *Hacker News Algolia API* and displays a list of results.
- Save the user's search terms in the Redux state.
	(You don't need to persist across sessions.)

### Tips
We're looking to see if what you know in React and Redux and querying an API.
We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies.
We don't care about design/UI (for this project).

### Resources
- Create React App
- Hacker News Algolia API: https://hn.algolia.com/api
