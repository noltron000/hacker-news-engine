Here's what we'd like to see for an at-home exercise:

Using React and Redux:

- Build an application that lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)

- Save the user's search terms in the Redux state (don't need to persist across sessions)
We're looking to see if what you know in React and Redux and querying an API. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design/UI (for this project)

Resources:
- create-react-app

- HN search API: https://hn.algolia.com/api

- Redux intro: https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux


Let us know if you have any questions! If you're good to go, please send us back your project at your convenience (please upload your project to a public git repository, such as Github).
