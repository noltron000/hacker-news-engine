# RTS Labs Take-Home Project
This is what we'd like to see for an at-home exercise.

## Requirements
- Use React and Redux to compleete this project.
- Build an application that lets the user search the *Hacker News Algolia API* and displays a list of results.
- Save the user's search terms in the Redux state. (you don't need to persist across sessions)

## Tips
We're looking to see if what you know in React and Redux and querying an API.
We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies.
We don't care about design/UI (for this project)

## Resources
- create-react-app
- Hacker News Algolia API: https://hn.algolia.com/api
- Redux intro: https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux

Let us know if you have any questions! If you're good to go, please send us back your project at your convenience (please upload your project to a public git repository, such as Github).
